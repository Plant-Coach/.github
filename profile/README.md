## What is Plant Coach?
- Plant Coach allows a user to plan and organize a vegetable garden through a series of tools based on 3rd-party weather APIs, custom planting logic, plant schedules, and periodic reminders.
- Plant Coach is is a distributed application, deployed on a Kubernetes cluster which is created and managed through my own automation in Terraform modules, Helm Charts and GitHub Actions/Pipelines.
- While I sought to make Plant Coach a remarkable organization tool for gardeners such as myself, it is also a playground for me to explore and learn what it takes to create a thoughtful experience for the end-user as well as for other developers who may work on it.

- Plant Coach's code repos are divided into 2 categories: *application* and *infrastructure*.
### Application
