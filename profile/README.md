### What is Plant Coach?
- An application comprised of these services:
  - [Backend Repo (New code added weekly!)](https://github.com/Plant-Coach/plant_coach_be)
  - [Weather Microservice Repo](https://github.com/Plant-Coach/plant_coach_weather_api)
- Plant Coach allows a user to plan and organize a vegetable garden through a series of tools based on 3rd-party weather APIs, custom planting logic, plant schedules, and periodic reminders.
- This project has been planned using Kanban-style tickets within GitHub Projects.


**Special Note:**
- These repos are constantly being updated. Rather than a finished project (so far), [Plant Coach BE](https://github.com/Plant-Coach/plant_coach_be) is a repo of ways I've sought to improve my abilities as a Ruby Developer.
