## What is Plant Coach?
- Plant Coach is a demo project where I can playground with new technologies and grow as a developer....perhaps someday it will be a wonderful application used by many.
- Plant Coach allows a user to plan and organize a vegetable garden through a series of tools based on 3rd-party weather APIs, custom planting logic, plant schedules, and periodic reminders.
- Plant Coach is also a playground for me to learn and refine technical skillsets and knowledge of current development trends.


- Plant Coach is a "distributed" application, deployed on a Kubernetes cluster that is created and managed with automation in Terraform modules, Helm Charts and GitHub Actions/Pipelines.
